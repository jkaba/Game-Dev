# RPG Maker MV

Scripts I wrote to use within RPG Maker MV Engine

Files:
- Enemy_Classes.js: Used to allow classes to be assigned to enemies
- Enemy_Levels.js: Used to allow enemies access to levels 
- JK_CreditsRoll.js: Used to create a scene which play display the game credits based on an external file
- JK_ManageDashing.js: Used to handle whether or not to allow "dashing" in the game
- JK_TitlePosition.js: Used to reposition the commands on the title screen
